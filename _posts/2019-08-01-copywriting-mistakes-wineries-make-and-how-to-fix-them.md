title:  "The biggest copywriting mistakes wineries make — and how to fix them"

If you run a winery, you’re probably making mistakes with your copywriting.

I feel comfortable making that prediction, because in the past three years I’ve visited over 100 wineries in California and the Pacific Northwest.

Experience shows me that nobody’s copy is perfect, and I’ve noticed some patterns in the mistakes that wineries tend to make.

My observations inspired me to write an in-depth article that explores five big copywriting mistakes that cost wineries money, with concrete examples and commentary. It should take about eight minutes to read.

While wineries have many opportunities to write badly, **I want to focus specifically on copywriting for winery websites.** This focus is directly motivated by two key takeaways from the [2019 Silicon Valley Bank State of the Wine Industry report](https://www.svb.com/globalassets/library/images/content/trends_and_insights/reports/wine_report/svb-2019-wine-report):

- Wine sales growth is slowing. Visitation in tasting rooms in Napa and Sonoma counties has been falling for the past five years — even as the number of tourists in Northern California’s wine country has *increased.*
- If wineries focused on Direct-To-Consumer sales want to grow, they need to focus on selling to their customers *where their customers are.* In many cases, that means cultivating a digital presence.

## 1. Focusing on themselves

Your winery is not about you.

Many vintners are under the mistaken impression that website visitors want to know their life history. That results in copy like this:

> Pete Helena was born and bred in the Napa Valley. He believes that the best wines embody the spirit of the land where they were grown. Since 1983, Helena Cellars has cultivated the valley’s best vineyards, creating Cabernet Sauvignon that showcases the beauty and subtly of benchland fruit. He invites you to raise a toast, from our family to yours.

This is a perfectly fine (albeit generic) biography of our imaginary vintner friend Pete. But it’s not good marketing copy, and it won’t generate good leads.

Here’s why: **your visitors are in it for themselves.** They don’t care about you. What they do care about is what you can do for them.

Make it easy for the people who might want to give you money  feel good about giving you money. Be upfront about the value that you offer.

Here’s how I would rewrite the paragraph above:

> **History matters.**
>
> Winemaker Pete Helena first dug into Napa Valley’s soil in 1983 — and he’s never stopped digging.
>
> We invite you to visit our family’s winery and taste the difference that deep roots make. Make a reservation today.

Here’s what I did:

- I started by positioning experience as an important differentiating factor for potential customers.
- I established that winemaker Pete has a lot of experience.
- I reiterated the importance of experience in a way that focuses on what the customer will taste when they visit — and ended with a clear call to action that will pull the customer a bit deeper into the sales funnel (but more on that later).

The main strategy is to get inside the heads of your visitors, think about what problems they might have, and then suggest a way you can solve their problems.

They won’t be interested if you just focus on yourself. But, if you can convince them that you have something to offer to them, they won’t immediately click away to check out one of your competitors instead.

**Fix it: Realize that no one cares about you. Find ways to make your copy relevant to your customers.**

## 2. Not defining calls to action

What do you want your users to do when they land on your website?

Do you want them to book a reservation in the tasting room? Are you hoping they join your wine club before they stop by for a visit?

Is your goal to get them to make an online purchase, wine untasted?

**Have you asked your visitors to do what you want?**

If you want a guest to do something when they visit your website, you need to ask them to *do* that thing. The more specific your call to action, the better.

For example, let’s say you want to grow your winery’s e-commerce channel. How would you encourage visitors who have never ordered online before to make a purchase with you?

Here are three strategies, with varying levels of effectiveness:

**Bad strategy**: A link in the navigation bar to a page titled “Our Wines” that leads to a digital storefront.

*Why it’s bad*: There’s no call to action here. What’s more, it’s not immediately obvious that “Our Wines” are available for purchase.

**Better strategy**: Adding an above-the-fold section with customer-focused copy that announces the release of your 2017 Zinfandel, with a button that allows the visitor to add that Zinfandel directly to their cart.

*Why it’s better*: It’s specific and clear.

- You’re not asking a visitor to wade through your store pages and pick out just any wine; instead, you’re highlighting a specific wine and eliminating the need for the visitor to make a choice.
- The “add to cart” button makes it immediately obvious that your wines are available for purchase online.

**Baller strategy**: Adding an above-the-fold Instagrammable photo of a gift pack containing a bottle each of Rosé, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel, plus a logo corkscrew. Below the photo would be a button that allows visitors to buy the gift pack with one click. Upon checkout, a promo is automatically applied, offering shipping included on their first online order.

*Why it’s baller*: The customer is never forced to think.

- Checkout is as simple as impulse-buying a Loch-Ness-monster-shaped soup ladle on Amazon.
- The gift set itself provides a solid introduction to your wines.
- Surprise shipping included is an unexpected reward. [A large body of behavioral research on operant conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning#Schedules_of_reinforcement) supports the finding that giving rewards on an unpredictable schedule leads to increased repetition of the rewarded behavior, even in the absence of the reward itself.

In other words, by applying surprise promotions *sometimes*, we’re training customers to keep spending (even without the reward of a promotion).

**Fix it: Remember that visitors to your website are likely interested in your brand already. Figure out what action you want them to take to deepen their relationship with your brand. Then ask them to do that.**

## 3. Not incorporating pictures

To paraphrase the saying: picture = 1000(word).

There’s a reason why people often mindlessly scroll through Instagram, while they never mindlessly read Proust’s In Search of Lost Time.

Reading is hard. Pictures are easy.

And wineries are supremely photogenic. If you work at a winery, I bet you could easily walk outside and take a photo of carefully-pruned vines, heavy with grapes, soaking up the wine country sunshine.

![](/assets/images/sunsetvine.jpg){: .img-fluid}

The picture does a better job at conveying the beauty of vineyards than the words, doesn’t it?

Here’s the difference in action.

Let’s imagine that I work for a winery that recently remodeled their space to create an outdoor experience for bottle service and seated tastings.

My goal would be to let people know about our new tasting experiences. It’s critical that we get the word out, since people strongly associate us with bar-style tastings.

Now, I could use words, like so:

> ### Do you dream of having your own backyard in the Napa Valley?
>
> While we can’t buy vacation homes for all of our wine club members, we want to do the next best thing.
>
> Our backyard has undergone a makeover, and we invite you to make yourself at home.
>
> Book a seated tasting now and experience your own Napa Valley backyard.

But conveying this message with an image is both easier and more effective:

We’ll still need to find a way to incorporate our call to action (book a reservation), but the image allows visitors to imagine themselves drinking wine in the backyard more vividly.

A bonus for pictures is that they break up walls of text and give visitors a visual breather. It’s a trick I use throughout this article.

**Fix it: Take a picture. It will have a bigger impact than words.**

## 4. Using too many words

No one likes to read a wall of text.

This is a wall of text. I’m including a huge amount of information in a single paragraph, as this is something I see all the time in winery websites and wine marketing emails. This text isn’t poorly written; the paragraph is well-structured and each sentence serves to emphasis the main point of the paragraph (namely, that the paragraph has quite a lot of words). In formal education, we’re taught to craft paragraphs with an introductory sentence, at least three body sentences, and a concluding sentence. And sure, that works for an essay on the use of symbolism in The Great Gatsby. But long paragraphs don’t entice readers to pay attention. In fact, I bet you’re skimming by now.

Good copywriting is not the kind of writing you learned in school. Write clearly, directly, and with minimal words.

![](/assets/images/gifs/fewword.gif){: .img-fluid}

If you absolutely must be verbose, format your copy to break up walls of text.

### Use headings to make your text easily skimmable

Give your **key takeaways** their own paragraphs (even if the “paragraph” consists of a single sentence).

- Bullet points can be useful for conveying complex information.
- Use them to make the important stuff clear at a glance.
- Turning big paragraphs into brief lists means your words are more likely to get read.

Notice that I’ve said more here than I did in that long paragraph above. Also notice how much easier it was to read.

> “By giving your words *space*, you invite readers to focus on what matters.”

**Fix it: Edit judiciously. Format your copy to avoid walls of text.**

## 5. Writing flowery tasting notes

After visiting over one hundred wineries in the Napa Valley, I'm intimately familiar with terrible tasting notes.

Here’s a terrible tasting note:

> Redolent with sous bois aromas of wild mushroom crostini, our 2016 Merlot showcases the soft tannins typical of fruit from the Rutherford bench. Flavors of ripe plum define the palate, with a cherry finish that lingers on and on.

Why is this a bad tasting note? Beyond the purple prose, it fails to appeal to any target demographic.

For the average consumer, your tasting note feels like a test they didn’t quite pass: perhaps they have a vague understanding of tannins, but the Rutherford bench is gibberish and wild mushroom crostini is obnoxiously specific. Congratulations: your winery is pretentious, and a potential lead has clicked away from your website in favor of visiting someone else who doesn’t alienate them with winespeak.

Maybe you’re aiming to appeal to wine nerds: congratulations, they also hate your tasting note. If you own a winery, you know you’d rather see this kind of tasting note:

> 2016 Rutherford Merlot: 78% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Barrel fermented and aged in 50% new French Oak, 50% neutral French Oak. Fermented with native yeasts, unfined, and unfiltered, this high acid, restrained Merlot can be aged for fifteen to twenty years.

Generally, you should avoid tasting notes in favor of storytelling. If you want to keep wine professionals happy, consider sharing technical information instead.

**Fix it: don’t write tasting notes. Think about what your target demographics want to hear, and write that instead.**

## Conclusion: There’s no secret to copywriting

My advice here boils down to the same advice professors have been teaching to students in Marketing 101 classes for decades:

**Write with your readers in mind.**

Businesses are not monoliths. At their heart, they hinge upon the relationship between brands and the people who support them.

If you don’t put genuine effort into creating a relationship with your visitors by anticipating their needs and putting effort into solving their problems, they will have no reason to invest in you.
